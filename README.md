# SignalComposer - MATLAB GUI

## Description
SignalComposer is a MATLAB GUI application that allows users to build piecewise-defined signals (DC, Ramp, Exponential, Polynomial, and Sinusoidal) and perform basic signal processing operations such as:
- Amplitude scaling
- Time shifting
- Time compression/expansion
- Time reversal

The tool is built using MATLAB's GUIDE framework and provides a simple, interactive way to visualize both original and processed signals.

## Features
- Create multiple signal segments and concatenate them.
- Real-time plotting of the composed signal.
- Easy controls for signal manipulation.
- GUI built using MATLAB GUIDE.

## Getting Started

1. Open `Last.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the script (`Run` button or `F5`).
3. Interact with the GUI to:
    - Set sampling frequency and breakpoints.
    - Add different signal types.
    - Apply transformations and visualize results.

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2016b or later (tested with GUIDE)
- Signal Processing Toolbox (optional for extended features)

## How to Use
- **Begin**: Set sampling frequency and number of breakpoints.
- **Add Segment**: Choose signal type and parameters for each segment.
- **Transform**: Apply amplitude scaling, time shift, expansion/compression, or time reversal.
- **Plot**: View original and processed signals.
